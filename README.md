## 📖 Introduction  
The **GlobalMart dataset** contains detailed information about orders, sales, profit, and returns.  
This project uses **Excel for data cleaning** and **Power BI for interactive dashboards with DAX formulas** to analyze business performance.  

The goal: provide **actionable insights** on **sales growth, profitability, returns, and customer trends**.  

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning (Excel)  
Before importing into Power BI, the dataset (`GlobalMart.xls`) was cleaned in Excel by:  
- ✅ Removing duplicates and invalid entries  
- ✅ Handling missing values (e.g., null profits/returns)  
- ✅ Standardizing column names (`Sales`, `Profit`, `Order Date`, etc.)  
- ✅ Creating derived fields like **Profit Ratio** for preliminary analysis  

---

## 🧮 DAX Modeling (Power BI)  

Power BI was used to create **key measures and calculations** for analysis:  

- **Base KPIs**  
```DAX
Sales = SUM('Orders'[Sales])
Profit = SUM('Orders'[Profit])

% Returned Orders = 
VAR total_ordrs =DISTINCTCOUNT(Orders[Order ID])
VAR Returned_orders =DISTINCTCOUNT(Returns2[Order ID])
VAR _Prec = DIVIDE(Returned_orders,total_ordrs)
RETURN
_Prec
```

- **Previous Year (PY) Metrics**  
```DAX
Sales PY = CALCULATE(SUM('Orders'[Sales]), SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date]))
Profit PY = CALCULATE(SUM('Orders'[Profit]), SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date]))
% Returned Orders PY = CALCULATE([% Returned Orders],SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date Table'[Date]))
```

- **Year-over-Year (vs PY) Calculations**  
```DAX
vs PY - Sales = [Sales] - [Sales PY]
vs PY - Profit = [Profit] - [Profit PY]
vs PY - % Returned Orders = [% Returned Orders] - [% Returned Orders PY]
```

- **Date Table for Time Intelligence**  
```DAX
Date Table = ADDCOLUMNS(CALENDAR(MIN(Orders[Order Date]),MAX(Orders[Order Date])),"Start of Month ",EOMONTH([Date],-1)+1)
```
